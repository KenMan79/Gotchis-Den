# Gotchis-Den

Blockchain Critters for Fighting, Breeding, Gambling for the Degens.

## What Is It

An experiment to create a blockchain-based game using gamefi techniques, modern tooling, and questionable code. Let's see what happens when a community can control and build the games they enjoy.

Gotchis-Den lets degenerates breed, feed, and train little critters for fighting, bank robberies, and possibly extreme parkour.

Give your Gotchis extreme abilities with anabolic steroids and other substances.

Above all, have fun, be positive and be ridiculous. This project should be fun to work on most of the time.

Please treat this as a social experiment where we can learn, experiment, build, and make frens.
